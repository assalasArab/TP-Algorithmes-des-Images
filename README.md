# TP-Image Algorithms 

This repository contains my lab work completed as part of my coursework on image algorithms. Iâ€™m sharing these with the goal of helping future students better understand some of the concepts and algorithms in image processing. I hope these examples will be useful for students as they get familiar with techniques covered in the course.

Content
Each lab covers specific topics and provides concrete examples of image processing methods:

Lab 1: Introduction to Pixels and Image Manipulation

Exploring image structure and pixel manipulation.
Basic modifications: inversion, brightness adjustment, etc.
Lab 2: Spatial Filtering

Applying filters to enhance and detect features in images.
Using convolutions with filters like Gaussian and Sobel.
Lab 3: Histograms and Contrast Enhancement

Creating and analyzing image histograms.
Techniques for contrast enhancement, such as histogram equalization.
Lab 4: Image Segmentation

Techniques for dividing an image into meaningful segments.
Segmentation methods: thresholding, clustering, contours.
Purpose
By sharing this lab work, I hope to provide resources to help other students understand and implement key concepts in image processing. I hope this repository will be useful for advancing their own projects.
